# 4th Data Challenge - Revenue Analysis for Legal Practice
This data analysis challenge is a part of the Data Analyst Accelerator Programme (July 2022 Intake) coordinated by Gen Infiniti Academy, Singapore. 
Deadline for this project is on the 24th of August 2022.

Data that were given are apportionment data, monthly cost-to-company data, and billing hours data for each lawyers.
The objectives of the data analysis are as follows:
- Strategies to adopt to reach revenue targets
- Performance in meeting the KPI
- Types of cases that brings in the most revenues
    - If there is any, who can take the case/ is there a distinction in skillsets/domain of each lawyers?
- How productive are the lawyers?
    - Does time correlate with their apportioned amount?

My project will be done in a jupyter notebook for ease of reporting the analyses.
